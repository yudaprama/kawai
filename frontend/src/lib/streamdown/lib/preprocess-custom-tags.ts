/**
 * Preprocesses markdown to prevent custom tag blocks from being broken apart
 * by the CommonMark parser. Two issues are addressed:
 *
 * 1. **Inline content after opening tag**: In CommonMark, HTML block types 6/7
 *    require the opening tag to start a line on its own (or be followed only by
 *    whitespace). When content appears on the same line as the opening tag
 *    (e.g. `<custom>content`), the parser treats it as inline HTML inside a
 *    paragraph instead of an HTML block, causing the tag to lose its structure.
 *    This function ensures the opening tag, content, and closing tag each
 *    occupy their own lines.
 *
 * 2. **Blank lines inside tag content**: HTML blocks end at blank lines, which
 *    causes custom tags with blank lines in their content to be split across
 *    multiple tokens. This function replaces blank lines within matched custom
 *    tag pairs with HTML comments (`<!---->`), so the markdown parser treats
 *    the entire tag block as a single unit.
