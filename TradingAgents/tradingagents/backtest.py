"""Run the graph over a grid of tickers and dates, and score what came back.

One run yields one decision, so it cannot say whether the system decides well.
This runs the same machinery over many (ticker, date) cells and reads the
aggregate. The decision log is the results table: every run already records its
rating and later settles it with realized and alpha return against the
instrument's regional benchmark, so there is nothing to record separately.

Scope: this evaluates decision quality. It is not a portfolio simulator, and
must not grow one. Turning a rating into a filled order needs a quantity, a fill
price and a cash ledger, none of which the system has; inventing them here would
put an execution model behind an evaluation tool. Cells are therefore
independent, and a portfolio, when given, is the same standing book for every
cell rather than a position carried forward.
