"""Reddit search fetcher for ticker-specific discussion posts.

Reads Reddit's public Atom/RSS search feed, searching all subreddits in one
combined request. The JSON search endpoint is WAF-blocked (``HTTP 403``) for
anonymous clients (#862), so RSS is the only path; it carries no score or comment
counts. On a 429 we back off once, honouring ``Retry-After``.

A fetch that fails is reported as ``<unavailable>``, never as "no posts found":
the two are different claims, and passing a rate-limited fetch off as silence
hands the sentiment analyst a signal that was never observed (#1295).

No API key required. Returns formatted plaintext blocks ready for prompt
injection and degrades gracefully — returns a placeholder string rather than
raising, so callers never special-case missing data.
