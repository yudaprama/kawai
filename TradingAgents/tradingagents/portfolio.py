"""The caller's book, as the decision agents see it.

Optional input to a run: what is held, at what average price, and how much cash
is free. Without it the agents cannot tell adding to a full position from
opening a new one. Three states are distinct and must stay so: a position, a
flat book, and no context at all, since treating "not provided" as "flat" would
invent a fact about the caller's account.

Broker-neutral by construction: quantities are generic units and the currency is
whatever label the caller passes, so nothing here implies a venue or an
execution path.
